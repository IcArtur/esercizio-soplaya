1) I would ask many details to a client that gives me this CSV, I'm making up all the information that are missing.

3) I am assuming that the dataset.csv file is in the root of the project.
4) It is not specified how to filter for date ranges. I used two query params: start_date and end_date. To filter we can
 use both of them, only one or none.
